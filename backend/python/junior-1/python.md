## Practice
- What will be displayed? Why?
  - ```python
    a = [1, 2]
    b = a
    b.append(3)

    print(a) # ?
    ```
  - ```python
    def f(a, b=[]):
        b.append(a)
  
        return b
  
    print(f(1)) # ?
    print(f(2)) # ?
    print(f(3)) # ?
    ```
- Why doesn't it work? Fix it.
```python
a = 'doesn't'

print(a) # Expected: doesn't. Result: error
```
- It is expected to show a string informing about `a`'s value on each iteration but for `a = 5` the string is shown twice. Why? Fix it. (*you can only work with `if` block*)
```python
for a in range(1, 11):
    if a == 5:
        print(f'a is equal to {a}')

    print(f'a is equal to {a}')
```
- Create a list of squares based on the input list using three ways:
  - `while` loop
  - `for` loop
  - list comprehension
```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = []
# Magic...
print(b) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
- Create a function that takes a positive integer to calculate the sum of it's digits
```python
print(f(123)) # 6
print(f(1337)) # 14
```
