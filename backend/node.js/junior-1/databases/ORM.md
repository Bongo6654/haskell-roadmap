# ORM

## Common

* What is ORM? Why do we prefer to use ORMs instead of native drivers?

## Typeorm
* What it is.
* Write a simple table with numbers, strings, and arrays.
* Write the relationship options:
  * OneToOne.
  * ManyToOne (OneToMany).
  * ManyToMany.
* Migrations
  * What are the commands for running and creating migrations?
  * If you need to add a new field to an existing table on a prod (or change the field type) what do you do?
* What is QueryBuilder?
* How do you load a record including relationships from a database? How to load only certain fields? Sorting and pagination?
