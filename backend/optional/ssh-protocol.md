# Secure shell protocol

This topic is intended to examine basic Ssh usage. Potentially this topic may become a part of a bigger future DevOps topic.

## Theoretical questions

* What is Ssh?
* What is Ssh default port?
* What are possible ways to authorize as ssh client?
* How to generate key pair to authorize via ssh-keys?
  * Where will these keys be stored?
  * Which one is a private key and which one is public? Can you view them?
* How to allow a client to authorize via ssh-keys on the server side?
* What commands can you use on a server as a client? Name a few or name their basis.
* How to transfer a file to a server?
* How to create an alias for a connection on the client side?
